| LED Pin (Left → Right) | LED Function     | Arduino Connection                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Left pin**           | Red cathode      | **Pin 6 → 220 Ω resistor → LED pin**  |
| **Second left (long)** | **Common anode** | **+5V**                               |
| **Second right**       | Green cathode    | **Pin 9 → 220 Ω resistor → LED pin**  |
| **Right pin**          | Blue cathode     | **Pin 10 → 220 Ω resistor → LED pin** |

***Important Note***

This LED is common-anode, so the logic is inverted:

  **analogWrite(pin, 0) → colour fully ON**

  **analogWrite(pin, 255) → colour OFF**

So a colour value of (R=255, G=0, B=255) means:

- Red off

- Green on

- Blue off
